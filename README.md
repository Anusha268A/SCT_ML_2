# Task 2: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Objective
Segment mall customers into distinct groups using **K-Means Clustering** based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The aim is to identify customer patterns for marketing strategies and business decisions.

## Dataset
- File: `data/Mall_Customers.csv`
- Contains customer information:
  - `CustomerID`
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`

## Notebook
- File: `notebooks/task2.ipynb`
- Steps implemented:
  1. Data loading and exploration
  2. Feature selection and scaling
  3. Optimal cluster selection using Elbow and Silhouette methods
  4. K-Means model training
  5. Cluster assignment and visualization
  6. Cluster profiling and insights

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
